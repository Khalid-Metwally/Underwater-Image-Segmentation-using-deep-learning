# Underwater-Image-Segmentation-using-deep-learning
Overview
This project explores the application of YOLO (You Only Look Once) models, specifically YOLOv5, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8, for underwater image masking and segmentation. The goal is to provide efficient and accurate methods for detecting and segmenting objects in underwater images.
